This project was bootstrapped with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev)

## Core Libraries

- [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Typescript](https://typescriptlang.org): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- [Ant Design UI React](https://ant.design): Ant Design UI is a development framework that helps create beautiful, responsive layouts.
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/docs/basics#installation): Utilising tagged template literals (a recent addition to JavaScript) and the power of CSS, styled-components allows you to write actual CSS code to style your components. It also removes the mapping between components and styles â€“ using components as a low-level styling construct could not be easier!. 99.9% of our styles are in styled components.

- [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/): The @testing-library family of packages helps you test UI components in a user-centric way.
